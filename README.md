# Workcation-Agenda
This is for Day Planner assignment in bootcamp.

The time-blocks of 9-5 alloe you to type, save and delete text stored locally, although delete refreshes with error, can still type over it to add another task and save.

Not sure if the colors are displaying for this time zone? The time blocks are color-coded for keeping track of your day and the current date and time is displayed at the top of the scheduler as well.
